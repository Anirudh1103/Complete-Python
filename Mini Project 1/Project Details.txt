We will be making SNAKE, WATER or GUN game as our project using all the knowledge we have till now.
Its going to be a simple project nothing complex.

we will be using:
1  -> SNAKE
-1 -> WATER
0  -> GUN

the above values will be used to replicate hands we have to write logic for the game

Game Rules: 
-Snake vs. water: Snake wins because it drinks the water 
-Water vs. gun: Water wins because the gun drowns 
-Gun vs. snake: Gun wins because it kills the snake 
-Draw: If both players choose the same object, the game is a draw
